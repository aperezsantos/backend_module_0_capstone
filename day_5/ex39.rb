### EXERCISES 39: HASHES
# Hashmap (hash) data structure - is a way to store data just like a list
# You can use numbers and basically anything else to get the data
# Essentially, a hash is a database that stores and organizes data

## ARRAYS VS HASHES
# Compare what hashes can do to what arrays lists can do:

# Arrays:
# This is an array with 4 elements
  # ?> things = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
  # => ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
# This is saying to print the element in position 1, which is b
  # >> puts things[1]
  # b
  # => nil
# This tells what will replace element b, and in this case, it will be replaced by z
  # >> things[1] = 'z'
  # => "z"
# This prints the new element in position 1, which is z
  # >> puts things[1]
  # z
  # => nil
# This prints the array
  # >> things
# This is the new array with element b replaced by z
  # => ["a", "z", "c", "d"]

## REMINDER
# "...you can use numbers to find out what's in arrays."
# In oder words "you can use numbers to "index" into a array"


# Hash:
# Hash lets you use numbers and other things as your index
# In other words, it associates one thing to another, and it doesn't matter what they are
# This array has 3 elements, all of which contain objects assigned to other objects
# For example, 39 is the assigned value to age
  # ?> stuff = {'name' => 'Zed', 'age' => 39, 'height' => 6 * 12 + 2}
  # => {"name"=>"Zed", "age"=>39, "height"=>74}
# This prints the element in the name position, which is Zed, since that was assigned to name
  # >> puts stuff['name']
  # Zed
  # => nil
  # >> puts stuff['age']
  # 39
  # => nil
  # >> puts stuff['height']
  # 74
  # => nil
# This puts a new element called city at the end of the array, and the assigned San Francisco
  # >> stuff['city'] = "San Francisco"
  # => "San Francisco"
# This prints the element city, which again, is San Francisco
  # >> print stuff['city']
  # San Francisco=> nil

## .DELETE METHOD
# You can delete elements from a hash with the .delete method
# You first type the name of the hash, followed by .delete and in connected parentheses, between quotations, you name the element to delete
  # ?> stuff.delete('city')
  # => "San Francisco"
  # >> stuff.delete(1)
  # => "Wow"
  # >> stuff.delete(2)
  # => "Neato"
  # >> stuff
  # => {"name"=>"Zed", "age"=>39, "height"=>74}

## TASK
# Type the following code.
# "Take note of when you put things in a hash, get them from a hash, and all the operations you use."
# "This example is mapping states to their abbreviations and then the abbreviations to cities in the states."

# create a mapping of state to abbreviation
states = {
  'Oregon' => 'OR',
  'Florida' => 'FL',
  'California' => 'CA',
  'New York' => 'NY',
  'Michigan' => 'MI'
}

# create a basic set of states and some cities in them
cities = {
  'CA' => 'San Francisco',
  'MI' => 'Detroit',
  'FL' => 'Jacksonville'
}

# add some more cities
cities['NY'] = 'New York'
cities['OR'] = 'Portland'

# puts out some cities
puts '-' * 10
puts "NY State has: #{cities['NY']}"
puts "OR State has: #{cities['OR']}"

# puts some states
puts '-' * 10
puts "Michigan's abbreviation is: #{states['Michigan']}"
puts "Florida's abbreviation is: #{states['Florida']}"

# do it by using the state then cities dict
puts '-' * 10
puts "Michigan has: #{cities[states['Michigan']]}"
puts "Florida has: #{cities[states['Florida']]}"

# puts every state abbreviation
puts '-' * 10
states.each do |state, abbrev|
  puts "#{state} is abbreviated #{abbrev}"
end

# puts every city in state
puts '-' * 10
cities.each do |abbrev, city|
  puts "#{abbrev} has the city #{city}"
end

# now do both at the same time
puts '-' * 10
states.each do |state, abbrev|
  city = cities[abbrev]
  puts "#{state} is abbreviated #{abbrev} and has city #{city}"
end

puts '-' * 10
# by default ruby says "nil" when something isn't in there
state = states['Texas']

if !state
  puts "Sorry, no Texas."
end

# default values using ||= with the nil result
city = cities['TX']
city ||= 'Does Not Exist'
puts "The city for the state 'TX' is: #{city}"

# You should see the following:
# ($ ruby ex39.rb
# ----------
# NY State has: New York
# OR State has: Portland
# ----------
# Michigan's abbreviation is: MI
# Florida's abbreviation is: FL
# ----------
# Michigan has: Detroit
# Florida has: Jacksonville
# ----------
# Oregon is abbreviated OR
# Florida is abbreviated FL
# California is abbreviated CA
# New York is abbreviated NY
# Michigan is abbreviated MI
# ----------
# CA has the city San Francisco
# MI has the city Detroit
# FL has the city Jacksonville
# NY has the city New York
# OR has the city Portland
# ----------
# Oregon is abbreviated OR and has city Portland
# Florida is abbreviated FL and has city Jacksonville
# California is abbreviated CA and has city San Francisco
# New York is abbreviated NY and has city New York
# Michigan is abbreviated MI and has city Detroit
# ----------
# Sorry, no Texas.
# The city for the state 'TX' is: Does Not Exist

## HASHES (real world example)
# They are commonly used to map or associate things you want to store to keys you need to get them
# Let's say you want to know what the workd "Honorificabilitudinitatibus" is
# These are the steps you would take before the internet was available
  #1. "Go to your library and get "the dictionary". Let's say it's the OED."
  #2. "You know "honorificabilitudinitatibus" starts with the letter 'H' so you look on the side of the book for the little tab that has 'H' on it."
  #3. "Then you'd skim the pages until you are close to where "hon" started."
  #4. "Then you'd skim a few more pages until you found "honorificabilitudinitatibus" or hit the beginning of the "hp" words and realize this word isn't in the OED."
  #5. "Once you found the entry, you'd read the definition to figure out what it means."
# This is basically what the process of a hash

## STUDY DRILLS
#1. Do this mapping with cities and sates/regions in your country

# Mexican sates and their abbreviations
states = {
  "Chihuahua" => "Chih.",
  "Zacatecas" => "Zac.",
  "Michoacan" => "Mich.",
  "Jalisco" => "Jal."
}

# Mexican states and their cities
cities = {
  "Chih." => "Chihuahua",
  "Zac."  => "RÃ­o Grande",
  "Mich." => "Morelia"
}

# More Mexican cities and their states
cities["Jal."] = "Guadalajara"

# Puts out some states
puts "-" * 10
puts "Chihuahua's abbreviation is: #{states["Chihuahua"]}"
puts "Michoacan's abbreviation is: #{states["Michoacan"]}"

# Puts out some cities
puts "-" * 10
puts "Jalisco has: #{cities["Jal."]}"
puts "Zacatecas has: #{cities["Zac."]}"

# do it by using the state then cities dict
puts '-' * 10
puts "Chihuahua has: #{cities[states["Chihuahua"]]}"

# puts every city in state
puts '-' * 10
cities.each do |abbrev, city|
  puts "#{abbrev} has the city #{city}"
end

# now do both at the same time
puts '-' * 10
states.each do |state, abbrev|
  city = cities[abbrev]
  puts "#{state} is abbreviated #{abbrev} and has city #{city}"
end

# now do both at the same time
puts '-' * 10
states.each do |state, abbrev|
  city = cities[abbrev]
  puts "#{state} is abbreviated #{abbrev} and has city #{city}"
end

#2. Find the Ruby documentation for hashes, and try to do more things to them
# You can use strings, arrays, integers, floats, and even hashes as keys.
# You an determine if a hash has a specific key with the has_key? method

#3. Find out what you can't do with hashes (fyi they do not have order)

## COMMON Qs
#Q. "What is the difference between an array and a hash?"
#A. "A array is for an ordered array of items. A hash (or hash) is for matching some items (called "keys") to other items (called "values")."

#Q. "What would I use a hash for?"
#A. "When you have to take one value and "look up" another value."

#Q. "What would I use an array for?"
#A. "Use an array for any sequence of things that need to be in order, and you only need to look them up by a numeric index."

## NOTES
# "A hash is a collection of data where each element of data is addressed by a name."
# For example, you keep a list of cats you have in the shelter you work at.
# You name eat type of cat, and give each type a value which is how mnay of the same type of cat are there.
# "tabby" might have the value 6, "black" might have the value 4, and so on and so forth.
# In hashes, the data is organized into "key/value pairs" like so:
  # hash name = {"key" => value}
  # cats = {"black" => 4}
# The key is the address, and the value is the data at that address
# The => rocket symbol links the key and value

## TRY
cats = {"tabby" => 6, "black" => 4}
puts "There are #{cats["black"]} cats in the shelter."

# This line adds a new value to the hash
cats["hairless"] = 2
# This prints the hash with the new key and value
p cats
# This line adds a new value to the hash
cats["maine_coon"] = 1
# This prints the hash with the new key and value
p cats
# This prints only the keys
p cats.keys
# This prints only the values
p cats.values

## TRY
# You can use symbols too.
produce = {apples: 3, oranges: 1, carrots: 12}
puts "There are #{produce[:oranges]} oranges in the fridge."
